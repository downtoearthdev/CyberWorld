# Dependency : 
1. Multiverse 
2. WorldEdit

# How to use ?
1. Run the plugin once. Let it generate ./plugins/Cyberworld/schematics/ ... etc
2. Stop the server.
3. Put the schematics files from world edit. Otherwise, the map would be empty because of no schematics read.
  You could get my version from https://github.com/kuohsuanlo/CyberWorld/blob/master/schematics/schematics.zip
  Just decompress and paste them.
4. Run the server again.
5. Generate the world with Multiverse commands and specify its world generator with *-g* : 
   /mv create YOUR_WORLD_NAME normal -g CyberWorld

BIOME_NUMBER_WITH_BUILDING: 4
  - Say your BIOME_TYPES is 3. There would be 8 biome (0~7), this is the number of biome that contains buildings, the rest of the biome would be nature biome. So biome *(0~4)* would be city, *(5~7)* would be nature.

BIOME_OCTAVE: 5
   - The city biomes' size, the larger it is , the larger each city biome would be.
